The files in this folder are slightly modified versions of some mosquitto source code files : https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto.
The modifications are not substantial and are just matter of removing lines or fixing variables values.
Full copyright and license remains intact and is included in the head of each file, complying with the original epl-2.0 license : https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/faq.php .
It is not clear to me if this constitutes a derivative work but, to be sure, the entire project will be licensed under the same epl-2.0 license as to maintain license compatibility.
